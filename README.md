## Understanding how Blockchain works

This small project is to understand how Blockchain works behind the scenes.
Blockchain is essentially a long list of blocks with its own unique ID created by 'hashing'. 
Each Block requires the ID of the previous block to create a new block by hashing its own contents along
with the ID of the previous block. This allows us to compare IDs inorder to ensure the the chain is correct
and untampered. The term 'mining' is how computers use its resources to verify the integrity of the Blockchain.
